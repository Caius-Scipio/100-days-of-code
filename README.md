# 100-days-of-code
This is a log of work done when doing the 100 days of code challenge

### Day 0: 2024 / 01 / 01

**Today's Progress**: Translated JS Sticky Note app to a React App. Although being a functional app, I have not yet ran the build and it currently just holds the JS files.

**Thoughts:** Turning vanilla JS code into React code is not as straight forward as I had thought. Though this is great practice, I don't think I'll do that moving forward.

### Day 10: 2024 / 01 / 02

**Today's Progress**: I updated thes styling of the stickynotes, compiled the build, then pushed it to GitHub. Ran into issues with the gh-pages/branches and took me two hours to rectify that.

**Thoughts:** Fixing a fix to a mistake leads down a dark rabbit hole. Sometimes it's easier to undo what you have done to make progress. That or I need to get better at GitHub. lol
