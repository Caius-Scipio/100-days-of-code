# 100-days-of-code
This is a log of work done when doing the 100 days of code challenge

### Day 5: 2024 / 01 / 06

**Today's Progress**: Added the footer and the testimonial page today.

**Thoughts:** Wasn't able to get the footer to look quite right nor the background colors for the testimonial cards. Those are now on my to-do list.

### Day 4: 2024 / 01 / 05

**Today's Progress**: Started work on placing holder text on a few pages. Creating the information and finding copyright free images took some time. However, the history page, team page, and contact page at least has some information.

**Thoughts:** As I start to put the structure of the site together, I see areas that can be improved and are being put on the to-do list. However, 3 of the 7 pages at least have something to display.

### Day 3: 2024 / 01 / 04

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the Navigation bar. I was able to implement dropdown navigation in Bootstrap, installed the React Router DOM, created starter pages for the site, and set up the Router to link to the site pages.

**Thoughts:** I attempted to change the colors used in Bootstrap, but I'll have to read the documentation for that later. It took up too much of my time. I wanted to get some progress with the naviagation bar done.

### Day 2: 2024 / 01 / 03

**Today's Progress**: Started a new project for an E-Commerce site. Created the company name, logo, color palette, Information Architecture, site theme, and site visual metaphor. Was able to add a basic navigation bar with the logo and top level navigation. 

**Thoughts:** I decided to use some Bootstrap with this project to get more familiar with it. Getting the logo onto the navbar ate a lot of my time. Turned out I needed to restart the server.

### Day 1: 2024 / 01 / 02 ðŸŽ‰

**Today's Progress**: I updated thes styling of the stickynotes, compiled the build, then pushed it to GitHub. Ran into issues with the gh-pages/branches and took me two hours to rectify that.

**Thoughts:** Fixing a fix to a mistake leads down a dark rabbit hole. Sometimes it's easier to undo what you have done to make progress. That or I need to get better at GitHub. lol

### Day 0: 2024 / 01 / 01

**Today's Progress**: Translated JS Sticky Note app to a React App. Although being a functional app, I have not yet ran the build and it currently just holds the JS files.

**Thoughts:** Turning vanilla JS code into React code is not as straight forward as I had thought. Though this is great practice, I don't think I'll do that moving forward.
