# 100-days-of-code
This is a log of work done when doing the 100 days of code challenge

### Day 22: 2024 / 01 / 23

**Today's Progress**: completed a CodeWars kata, did 3 CondinGame dev battles, and began a w3schools tutorial on Accessibility.

**Thoughts**: The CodeWars kata was an easy one to solve, despite the claimed level of it. A simple string to insert a space in front of a capital letter. I'm sure some might find it difficult and I'm sure I'd find other tasks at the same level more challenging.

### Day 21: 2024 / 01 / 22

**Today's Progress**: completed a CodeWars kata about curry functions, completed a CodinGame puzzle about greedy algorithms, did 3 CondinGame dev battles, and finished the w3schools Bootstrap learning with an Intermediate level.

**Thoughts**: curry functions were interesting, though this was the first time encountering them, I doubt I can create one without a helping hand. I have yet to complete the w3schools test for Bootstrap, so my level/understanding of it might be a smidge higher. For now, I should focus on Accessibility and JavaScript, then circle back around to the others as I gain more experience with them.

### Day 20: 2024 / 01 / 21

**Today's Progress**: a CodeWars kata about memoizing a fibonocci sequence, a CodinGame puzzle determining Happy Numbers, 4 CondinGame dev battles, and progressed in Bootstrap learning with w3schools.

**Thoughts**: I've learned about memoizing, but haven't implemented it before. Today was the first time. It's a topic I'll like to dive deeper into at some point.

### Day 19: 2024 / 01 / 20

**Today's Progress**: CodeWars Kata, CodinGame puzzle, 4 CodinGame dev battle, Bootsrap learning, and Bootstrap practice activities with w3schools.

**Thughts**: For not feeling like doing a lot, the dev battles took an hour by itself. The kata and puzzle combined probably took an hour and the Bootstrap activities took an hour or two. The code challelenge is supposed to be code 1 hour per day everyday for 100 day. Should I be slowing down?

### Day 18: 2024 / 01 / 19 üéñÔ∏è

**Today's Progress**: I took a CSS skill test at w3schools and for not really working directly with CSS in a few months scored in the Professional category.

**Thoughts**: After noticing their educational material had been updated and deciding to take a skill test, I went back for the CSS test. I also noticed that I set the test level to "intermediate" yet scored "professional." I might circle back and and up the test level to see what happens.

### Day 17: 2024 / 01 / 18

**Today's Progress**: I spent time solving coding problems on CodeWars, CodinGame, and at w3resource.

**Thoughts**: Today was a busy day for me, so the list above was about the only things I could squeeze in. Solving a coding puzzle in CodinGame awarded me with a legendary badge for JavaScript. Not especially impotant, but it did bring a smile to face.

### Day 16: 2024 / 01 / 17 üéñÔ∏è

**Today's Progress**: I took an HTML skill test at w3schools and for not really working directly with HTML in a few months scored in the Professional category.

**Thoughts**: I was looking at w3schools JavaScript reference to focus on an issue I was facing, I noticed their educational material had been updated and decidied to take a skill test. They have others and I'll be looking at taking them in the future. The Barks and Bubbles site will be put on the back burner for the time being.

### Day 15: 2024 / 01 / 16 üìú

**Today's Progress**: Today, I spent time on CondinGame battling other programmers to solve problems. Turned out, I was able to receive a certification which was pretty cool.

**Thoughts**: There are many many things to learn and practice. Some of the softer skills are often overlooked. Today I spent time attempting to solve problems against a clock ... and other players. It was a lot of fun and will probably distract me from the Barks and Bubbles web site I'm attempting to make. Feel free to add me, I'll drop the link below.

### Day 14: 2024 / 01 / 15

**Today's Progress**: Not much pushed today, just editing the footer to make that functional.

**Thoughts**: Can't seem to find the files in Bootstrap to alter the colors. Finding each element individually to alter the colors seems tedious. I'll keep searching for a solution. Otherwise, I wanted to get something pushed today, and that was the footer. Still have some edits to make on it, though.

### Day 13: 2024 / 01 / 14

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the active class so it properly applies to the active page and started to read documentation to customize Bootstrap colors.

**Thoughts**: I ended up goin with a ternary operator and useState and it works, but it also seems to interfere a bit with how Bootstrap's JS is dealing with dropdown menus. Something I'll have to debug later. Was pretty unsuccessful changing the colors in broad brush strokes. There has to be something I'm missing.

### Day 12: 2024 / 01 / 13

**Today's Progress**: Created data for another product page, added images for display, and populated card of products.

**Thoughts**: Today was slowed down only because I was looking for images. The coding went pretty smoothly, especially since the page yesterday was completed. A few things left to do before a review of the site, a conversation with the "owner," and then on to looking at customizing colors in Bootstrap and adding in some fun theme elements.

### Day 11: 2024 / 01 / 12

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the format of the product page made earlier while cleaning up some of the code for better readability and enhancing performance.

**Thoughts**: Although the original code for the page was correct, it was less than ideal code. It actually took more time dissecting what was done to understand what it was doing. Sometimes code to stomp out fires is not the best solution.

### Day 10: 2024 / 01 / 11

**Today's Progress**: Got super distracted today with a coding website called ConinGame. I spent way too much time coding solutions to prblems they have on their site.

**Thoughts**: I got distracted, but I still spent time coding. I made no progress on my current project, but it felt good to have a break and just code for fun.

### Day 9: 2024 / 01 / 10

**Today's Progress**: Added a products to fillout one of the pages. Generated a few images to rotate between them all.

**Thoughts**: Super don't like the product card being used currently. I will probably fix that tomorrow. Also there is probably a more elegant solution that can be done that I'll try to work on tomorrow as well.

### Day 8: 2024 / 01 / 09

**Today's Progress**: Created a sample product card, added two example products as an object to populate the cards, and pushed them.

**Thoughts**: This took longer than expected, but I figured out a way to get the task done. Maybe not pretty, but correct. I am not happy with the design of the card, but I'm still in pre-production phase so I'll leave it be for now.

### Day 7: 2024 / 01 / 08

**Today's Progress**: Attempted to create a product card to render multiple products but was unable to get it working. No useful information to push to the project today.

**Thoughts**: I was only able to get halfway through setting up the structure needed to complete this task. I'll need to continue to work on it tomorrow.

### Day 6: 2024 / 01 / 07

**Today's Progress**: Added the services under grooming and started the dog food page.

**Thoughts**: I've forgotten how to create an populate a template with information from an object. Guess I'll be reading documentation tomorrow.

### Day 5: 2024 / 01 / 06

**Today's Progress**: Added the footer and the testimonial page today.

**Thoughts**: Wasn't able to get the footer to look quite right nor the background colors for the testimonial cards. Those are now on my to-do list.

### Day 4: 2024 / 01 / 05

**Today's Progress**: Started work on placing holder text on a few pages. Creating the information and finding copyright free images took some time. However, the history page, team page, and contact page at least has some information.

**Thoughts**: As I start to put the structure of the site together, I see areas that can be improved and are being put on the to-do list. However, 3 of the 7 pages at least have something to display.

### Day 3: 2024 / 01 / 04

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the Navigation bar. I was able to implement dropdown navigation in Bootstrap, installed the React Router DOM, created starter pages for the site, and set up the Router to link to the site pages.

**Thoughts**: I attempted to change the colors used in Bootstrap, but I'll have to read the documentation for that later. It took up too much of my time. I wanted to get some progress with the naviagation bar done.

### Day 2: 2024 / 01 / 03

**Today's Progress**: Started a new project for an E-Commerce site. Created the company name, logo, color palette, Information Architecture, site theme, and site visual metaphor. Was able to add a basic navigation bar with the logo and top level navigation. 

**Thoughts**: I decided to use some Bootstrap with this project to get more familiar with it. Getting the logo onto the navbar ate a lot of my time. Turned out I needed to restart the server.

### Day 1: 2024 / 01 / 02 üéâ

**Today's Progress**: I updated thes styling of the stickynotes, compiled the build, then pushed it to GitHub. Ran into issues with the gh-pages/branches and took me two hours to rectify that.

**Thoughts**: Fixing a fix to a mistake leads down a dark rabbit hole. Sometimes it's easier to undo what you have done to make progress. That or I need to get better at GitHub. lol

### Day 0: 2024 / 01 / 01

**Today's Progress**: Translated JS Sticky Note app to a React App. Although being a functional app, I have not yet ran the build and it currently just holds the JS files.

**Thoughts**: Turning vanilla JS code into React code is not as straight forward as I had thought. Though this is great practice, I don't think I'll do that moving forward.
